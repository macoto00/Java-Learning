package counter;

public class Counter {

//    Create Counter class
//    which has a counter (integer) field
//    at creation it should have a default value 0
//    there are two ways to create the class:
//    with 0 input parameters
//    with 1 input parameter called counter which is set as the initial value of the counter field
//    we can add another whole number to this counter: add(number)
//    we can just increase the counter's value by one: add() (no parameters)
//    we can get() the current counter value
//    and we can reset() the counter to the initial value set during the construction of the class
//    Check if everything works fine with the proper tests:
//    Download CounterTest.java and place it next to your solution
//    If you are unsure about how to get this running, you can watch a video tutorial
//    Other hints for running:
//    If something gets red:
//    Windows, Linux:
//    press ALT+Enter and add JUnit5 to classpath (5 aka JUnit FIVE not 4 or 3)
//    OSX:
//    press ⌥⏎ and add JUnit5 to classpath (5 aka JUnit FIVE not 4 or 3)
//    Run the tests one by one with the green play button before the method name (or run all of by pressing the button before the classname)
